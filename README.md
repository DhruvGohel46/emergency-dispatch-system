## 📉 The Critical Gap

In the Golden Hour, certainty saves lives. Yet, India's current infrastructure relies on manual coordination, leading to fatal delays.

| Current System (108/112) ❌ | SaHaay Autonomous Grid ✅ |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Manual Dispatch** via Call Centers | **Instant AI Dispatch** (< 200ms) |
| **Blind Waiting** (No Tracking) | **Live Uber-style Tracking** |
| **Single Point of Failure** | **Self-Healing Failover** (Breakdown/Traffic) |
| **Network Dependent** | **Offline SMS-First Mechanism** |
| **Opaque Operations** | **Full Digital Audit Trail** |

## 🧠 Autonomous Architecture

SaHaay replaces human guesswork with intelligent orchestration. The system autonomously manages the entire lifecycle of an emergency—from detection to hospital admission.

## 🔥 Key Capabilities

### 1. ⚡ Intelligent Dispatch Engine
- **Nearest-First Logic**: Automatically pings ambulances within 500m. Expands to 1km+ dynamically if no response is received within 120 seconds.
- **Race Condition Handling**: The first driver to "Accept" locks the mission; others are instantly released.

### 2. 🛡️ Self-Healing Failover
- **Breakdown Protection**: If an ambulance halts unexpectedly or reports a breakdown, the system **automatically** re-triggers the dispatch process from the ambulance's current location to find a replacement vehicle.
- **No Human Intervention**: The transfer happens computationally, separate from the driver's panic.

### 3. 📡 Disaster-Ready Offline Mode (DIL)
- **Zero-Internet/Data Protocol**: Uses a specialized GSM/SMS transport layer.
- **Protocol**: `SOS|UID:123|LAT:28.6|LON:77.2`
- **Mechanism**: The backend runs a "Clockless" state machine that sequences SMS packets to reconstruct the emergency state even during network blackouts.

### 4. 🚦 Green Corridor Integration
- **Traffic Pre-emption**: Integration with Smart City APIs to turn signals green along the ambulance's calculated route.

## 🚀 Deployment & Scalability

SaHaay is designed as a **Cloud-Native Microservices** architecture, capable of horizontal scaling to support nation-wide deployment.

- **State-Level Sharding**: Data is partitioned by region (e.g., `db_maharashtra`, `db_karnataka`) for low-latency access.
- **Containerization**: All services are Dockerized for rapid deployment across AWS/Azure or on-premise Government Data Centers.

### Quick Start (Simulator)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ahad-Dngwala/SAHAAY.github.io.git

# 2. Install Dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start Mission Control (Backend + Simulator)
npm start

# 4. Launch Offline Simulation (No Internet)
# Open http://localhost:3000/citizen.html to trigger SOS via simulated GSM
```
